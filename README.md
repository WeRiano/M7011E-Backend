# M7011E-Backend
This is the (user) backend service component of the [microservice-system](github.com/WeRiano/M7011E) created for the course M7011E at
Lule√• Tekniska Universitet. 

# How it works

This service stores users in a database. 

A user is defined by the following information/fields:

* `admin` - A boolean which describes if the user is defined as a superuser or not.
* `id` - A integer which serves as a unique identifier between different users.
* `email` - The users email address.
* `password` - The users password as a sha256 hash.
* `date_joined` - The date and time when the user was created.
* `last_login` - The date and time when the user last created an authorization token through the 
[`token/login`](#post-tokenlogin) endpoint.
* `house_img` - A local url to an image file that serves as the users profile picture.
* `first_name` - The users name.
* `last_name` - The users surname.
* `address` - The users address of residence which is defined as a name followed by an integer. 
For example: Slottsbacken 4.
* `city` - The users city of residence. For example: Stockholm.
* `zip_code` - The users zip code which must be an integer on the interval `[10000, 99000)`.

A user can be created, edited and deleted through the [REST API](#api-documentation).

For installation instructions and more, see the [README](https://github.com/WeRiano/M7011E/blob/main/README.md) 
of the overall system.

# API Documentation

All HTTP endpoints are located under the following base url:

`<service_ip>:<service_port>/api/`. 

You must then specify which version of the API that you intend to use by appending `version/<version_nr>/` 
to the base url.

All endpoints return a response in JSON format.

## `api/version/1/`

### Authorization Token

Several endpoint described below requires an authorization token. The token has to be provided as an `Authorization` 
HTTP header in the following format:

`Token <hash>`

Below is an example screenshot from Postman

The password does not need to be hashed manually but is done so by the service.

#### Result

Also updates the `last_login` field for the given user in the database.

### POST `token/logout/`

#### Parameters

An HTTP [`Authorization`](#authorization-token) header which can be acquired from the 
[`token/login/`](#post-tokenlogin) endpoint.

#### Result

### POST `users/`

#### Parameters

A JSON body with the following fields:

* `email`
* `first_name`
* `last_name`
